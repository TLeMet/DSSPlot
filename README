After doing all-atom MD simulations of proteins, we wanted to assign secondary structure over the run.

GROMACS has a do_dssp function that uses the xssp algorithm to read each frame and output the number of amino acids that it finds in each 2ndary.

This script plots the ratio of amino acids in alpha-helix over .xvg's for as many runs as wanted
